Examples were worked from: 
Sobell, Mark G., and Matthew Helmke. A Practical Guide to Linux Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming. Addison-Wesley, 2018.
Ch13: The MariaDB SQL Datase Management System. 

The files are interactive sql statements and a bash script.
They will not work unless you follow the examples from the text book.
I've included a document that shows the examples worked in order.
I think there is enough there where you could follow and then use the interactive commands and script, 
but I haven't verified this. 
The document is condensed version of my notes working the examples.
